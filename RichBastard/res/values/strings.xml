        Welcome to the Rich Bastard application!\n
        In this game your goal is to answer correctly as many questions as possible.\n
        There are three game modes: <b>Classic game</b>, which resembles a popular TV show, 
        <b>Thematical</b> game, where the questions are from a particular topic, 
        and a <b>Blitz round</b>, where you have limited time to think, so you\'d better be quick!\n
        \n
        Each question has 4 answer choices, only <i>one</i> of which is correct. 
        You may also use one of each three <b>hints:</b>\n
        * <i>50x50</i> - removes two wrong answer choices.\n
        * <i>Ask the audience</i> - the real-life simulation of a audience responses, with normal distribution.\n
        * <i>Change the question</i> - if you find the question too challenging, you may use this hint to change it to a another one.
        But be vary! If you have used previous hints on this question, the new question won\'t have the results of these hints.\n
        \n 
        Good luck, and become rich, bastard! =)\n
